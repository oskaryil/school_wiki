# Prototyping and testing

There are a few common methodologies in interaction design when it comes to the workflow.

There are a few parts:
* Conceptual phase
* Processing phase
* Detail phase
* Hand-over
* Finish (wrap-up)

Common ways of prototyping an idea:
* Sketch
* Storyboard

When you want to test the interactability of your prototype on a user there are a couple of methods that you could turn to.

## Thinking out loud test
The **thinking out loud ** test involes another person that you ask to test your product/prototype. It revolves around the user saying and expressing everything that they're thinking of when using your prototype. This test usually gives you a better overview and understanding of what your app is like to use from a user's perspective.

During these tests, things that you might not even have thought of might show up. Usually when developing and creating a new product for example an app, it's hard to think about what could go wrong etc. because you as the developer know how to do everything and how everything works. For a user on the other hand it is a completely new experience and all possible actions for the user to perform might not be perfectly clear. 

## Heuristic evaluation

## Wizard of Oz

You have one test person and one person "behind the scenes". So for example when the test person clicks the button the person behind the scenes does something. This is to see if the concept of the idea works.
