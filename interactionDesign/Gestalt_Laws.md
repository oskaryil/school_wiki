**Pragnanz** the word itself comes from the German language and means "good figure". It is sometimes referred to as the law of good figure or the law of simplicity. 

This law implies that objects in an environment are seen in a way that makes them appear as simple as possible. 

## Law of Proximity

Things that are positioned close to each other may appear like they are grouped together. We tend to group objects that are close to each other together.

## Law of Continuity

When there are multiple points we as humans tend to connect them together i.e instead of seeing a bunch of individual points we see a continued pattern or line. 

## Law of Closure

The Law of Closure implies that things are grouped together if it comepletes or looks like some entity ex. a shape like a circle or rectangle. Our brains tend to fill in the missing gaps in order to create an image.
