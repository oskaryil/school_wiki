# Don Norman's Seven Principles of Design

## Visibility / Discoverability
* The user must know about all possibilities and how to access them.
	* As an example a user must know how to start a computer the right away

**To summarize**: Not much effort should be requried by the user to find out how to use something.

## Feedback
* When a user does something, feedback is expected. 

Feedback is information that signifies that something has occured after the user has exectued an action. Feedback can be in the form of a sound, tactile feedback, verbal or visual. 

An example is that if you press a *call to action* button in an app or on a website you expect to see something change and happen on the screen. If you don't see something change you might just try to press the button again even though something has happened. 

## Constraints
* Design concept to limit and determine the user interaction that can occur at a given moment.

"Steering" the user to making pre-determined choices to avoid misconceptions and misunderstandings.

## Mapping
* Relation between control and effect
	* With good design the control of something gives a good idea about what will happen once it is used.
	* An example: Vertical scroll bar

The user should not have to think about how to use a product.

## Consistency / Conceptual model

When the user stumbles upon an object they should be able to create a conceptual model in their brain about how to use the object and which effect an action will trigger.

Similar actions should produce similar effect each time.

* Interfaces should contain similar operations and similar elements for things that trigger similar tasks.

## Affordance
* The relationship between how something looks and how it's used.
* Possible actions
* "Leading" the user to doing something.
	* an "invite"

An example is on a website a user should know how to find the information they're looking for on the site or they'll leave it.

## Signifiers
* Tells the user that there is something to be done here i.e an action

Signifiers are introducted to show an affordance.

An easy example is a door handle, it signifies that you can press or pull it as an action for feedback.

It is hard to create s standard with signifiers because there's patents for everything like Apple's unlock swipe from left to right on the lock screen.
